# Train Accident Analysis: Project Overview

In this analysis, I explore an accident dataset from the Federal Railroad Administration, which features data about accidents that happened in the US in the year 2022 (up until the end of November) as reported by railroad companies. 

[Data source](https://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/publicsite/on_the_fly_download.aspx)

Python Version: 3.10.9 Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn,folium, kmodes

## This analysis consists of several parts:

- Explore the dataset using visualization tools in matplotlib and seaborn. 
-
-
-

## EDA

Used bar plots, pie charts, and folium maps to visualize the distributions and relationships between various variables. This dataset contained 114 features, so this was an extensive process. Below are some of the highlits.
